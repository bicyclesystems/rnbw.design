## our approach
at rnbw, we are dedicated to a ux-driven approach. this means our priority is the user experience, ensuring we tackle the right challenges. the code? it's just the physical representation of our well-considered designs.

## design-first strategy
we adopt a design-first strategy.

1. **documenting the current design:** we begin by detailing the product as it currently stands.
2. **envisioning the future design:** next, we update our design documents to mirror how we envision the product evolving.
3. **developing to match:** we implement changes to the product only after it meets our updated design specifications.
