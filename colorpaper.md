# rnbw

this colorpaper is intended for under, the rnbw team, users, partners, and contributors. its purpose is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the products and services we offer and the activities involved in bringing them to market and effectively reaching our target audience. this is an endless, never-ending process of adjustment and refinement, and so is this document.

### note from eden

i am an individualist with a style that cannot be found in any book. i enjoy thinking, writing, visualizing, and coding. i am a designer, but i don't mind what people call me. i just focus on doing what i love - creating unique brands and products. as part of my work, i have also built some tools. tools tools tools.

these tools don't just help us make things. they also push the whole tech world to try new things and improve how humans make things, in a never-ending cycle of getting better.

tools are fascinating. we shape them, and then they shape us. there’s something meta in them that i’ve been drawn to since childhood: things that create, musical instruments, modular things, legos. design tools are a crucial element in our everyday lives.

these thoughts and experiences led me down the rabbit hole to the history of software development and design tools.

from xerox's desktop publishing to adobe's pdf and photoshop, and figma's pioneering user interface design, design tools have shaped how we create and collaborate. these tools have guided us through an evolution, leading us to this collaborative design era.

even though we have advanced design tools, many are still built for old print media tasks, not for today's digital screens. this mismatch slows down work because it requires extra steps to turn designs into working digital products.

this problem opens a big chance for us to think differently about how we make and use design tools. by solving this, we can make design and development faster and more connected, which helps everyone create better products quickly.

tim berners-lee, who created the world wide web, mentioned that the first web browser was also an editor. however, it was too early, and it couldn't turn it into a design tool. instead, we needed to write code to make it work. now, things have changed. the limitation is gone. today, browsers can easily be used as design tools—if we want to!

here lies a golden opportunity. we can reinvent how we approach design and software development, allowing us to harness the full potential of both disciplines.

ai's capabilities are set to revolutionize the creation process by essentially automating coding tasks. this shift brings design to the forefront while the development role evolves. this freedom from grunt work lets us focus on the bigger picture. we can focus more on design, driving creation that is faster, smarter, and more efficient than ever.

## wait but why

brand story - people think rainbow is just half circle, but the truth is a rainbow is a full circle. surprising, right? when we usually see a rainbow, it's from the ground and our horizon limits our view to just a half-circle or arc. but if you ever get a chance to see a rainbow from an airplane, or from a high mountain, you'll see it's a complete circle. this is due to the raindrops scattering light in every direction, and it's only our perspective on the ground that limits our view.

like a rainbow, the whole world of design and development often goes unseen. we get tangled up in tiny details, forgetting the big picture.

design and development are two sides of the same coin, not separate worlds. but for so long, we've treated them as if they were. here's the big secret - design is the practice of creation, and development is the process of realization, bringing those creations to life.

with rnbw, we're highlighting this hidden truth. we're showing the whole rainbow, not just half. by bringing together design and development, we're making creating for the web easier, more natural, and more effective.

welcome to the age of full-circle creation.

welcome to rnbw.

### it’s a business problem

imagine you're launching a company with a groundbreaking app idea that solves a real-world issue. traditionally, the design and development stages are distinct—designers map out the interface, then developers interpret these designs into code. this separation often leads to miscommunication and inefficiencies, impacting user experience and squandering resources.

rnbw doesn't just bridge the gap - it eliminates it by merging design and code into a unified workflow. in rnbw, design is code and code is design. this seamless integration accelerates the development process by allowing changes to be visualized and implemented in real time. the result is a dynamic, collaborative environment where modifications on the design front instantly reflect in the code and vice versa.

this approach not only streamlines production but also enhances collaboration among team members, ensuring that the final product faithfully represents the initial vision without the typical losses in translation.

### the original sin

today's design tools claim to offer a "single source of truth" for a product's design system. however, it raises the question of where the actual truth lies. is it in the designs created using these tools? or does it lie in the code used by developers to build the application? or, perhaps, do the tools that bridge design and code represent a third, separate truth?

most of today's design tools are built on a wrong idea: that design and development live in separate, imaginary worlds. but if design lives in too many different worlds, none of which are the actual code running on people's devices, it can never reach a 'single source of truth.’

some people believe that website builders can help solve the problem of building a website, but in reality, they are just tools for building websites and not for designing them. these builders are suitable for creating simple websites, but not for web applications that require a more flexible and advanced user interface to handle their complexity. unfortunately, website builders are not capable of providing such advanced user interfaces.

here we are still struggling with the same old issue, searching for a single source of truth. since no tools effectively support this, it ultimately depends on personal communication.

### source of truth

with rnbw, we no longer need a 'single source of truth.' sounds meh? let me explain. in this world, design doesn't just exist - it thrives right in the heart of production.

no more juggling multiple mediums trying to match design with code. in this world, designers feel right at home in a straightforward design environment. but there's a twist. they're not just sketching pictures – they're shaping the actual thing!

and while they do that, code is being cooked up in the background and blended into the development. magic, isn't it?

what’s the secret sauce? a refreshingly simple design experience that is also a development environment. designers own their designs and have the power to shape the live product.

updates happen in the blink of an eye. no more waiting for developers. design is instant.

product teams no longer need to trade off product quality. they can deliver an exceptional user experience. everyone involved in the product cycle can see, touch, and interact with the product in real-time, visually, and in context.

### i design. therefore, i code

designers today are changing. they're becoming swiss army knives, masters of many trades, and the market loves it—the demand for these designer-developer hybrids has spiked.

there's a massive low and no code category expected to grow, changing the entire software development space as the barrier to becoming a developer is very low thanks to ai and automation.

industry giants like facebook, google, and airbnb recognize the power of design and design systems. they're hiring top talent and developing internal tools to keep these systems strong and effective.

but what about the others? big enterprise companies are pouring time and money into trying to keep up. picture teams spread across the globe, facing talent shortages, isolated offices, and tricky time zones. enforcing consistent design systems is a challenge.

then there are the small fries - freelancers, code-savvy designers, design-savvy coders, lean startups, and fast-growing young companies. they don't have the resources to focus on design systems. these systems, if they exist at all, are often half-baked, leading to problems down the line.

Here's an expanded and more engaging version of the "The Web is Now Amazing" section, providing more details about each advancement, especially focusing on the widespread adoption of web components:

### the web is now amazing

the web continues to evolve rapidly, driven by significant advancements in web standards and technologies. here’s a closer look at some of the most impactful updates, enabling something like rnbw.

1. css updates - modern css features like css grid and subgrid have revolutionized web design, allowing developers to create more complex and responsive layouts that maintain consistency across different browsers. these tools help in building layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and devices effortlessly (mdn [web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/interop2023-mdn-doc-updates/)).
2. interop 2023 - this initiative aims to enhance how well web features work across different browsers. by focusing on interoperability, interop 2023 helps ensure that users have a uniform experience no matter their choice of browser, reducing the headaches for developers when testing across platforms (mdn [web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/interop2023-mdn-doc-updates/)).
3. html and dom api enhancements: ongoing improvements to html and dom apis have made web pages more interactive and dynamic. these enhancements allow developers to implement advanced functions and effects, enriching the user interaction without compromising performance.
4. web components - web components represent a major leap in creating reusable and maintainable design systems and web applications. these encapsulated elements can be used across different projects and websites, significantly speeding up development times and reducing errors. their adoption has become a standard practice among both large corporations and small startups, underlining their effectiveness in modern web development.
5. performance improvements - advances in browser technology and coding standards have led to faster web pages that are more efficient to run. these improvements not only enhance user satisfaction by providing quicker interactions but also contribute to better seo as page speed is a critical factor in search engine rankings.
6. progressive web apps (pwas) - pwas use modern web capabilities to deliver app-like experiences to users. they can work offline, receive push notifications, and access device hardware, which positions them as a powerful alternative to traditional mobile apps. this technology enhances the user experience dramatically by making web applications behave more like native apps.
7. the file system access api - a significant web standard implemented in chrome that enhances the capabilities of web applications to interact with files locally on a user's device. this api allows web apps to read or save changes directly to files and folders on the user’s device, once the user has granted permission. this is particularly useful for desktop applications which can benefit from native-like file handling capabilities.

## ✨ design-as-code

"what's the secret sauce?" - it’s design-as-code. it's a unique design approach that's built into a design tool, powered by code from the ground up, which uses a two-way design-code engine. this approach eliminates the need for handoff and traditional design platforms. with a perfect blend of simplicity, flexibility, and openness, it’s a game-changing solution for design professionals.

fast, zero latency, two-way design<>code synchronization. this means that you can make changes on one side and see the result immediately on the other side without any delay or interruption. speed is crucial in this process, whether you are loading a page, adding or modifying elements, or making an api call. our goal is to boost performance and reduce response times, always striving to enhance speed and prioritize user convenience over our ease of development.
