                <h3>note from eden</h3>
                <p>i enjoy thinking, writing,                    visualizing, and coding. i am a designer, but i don't mind what people call me. i just focus on                    doing what i love - creating unique brands and products. as part of my work, i have also built some
                    tools. tools tools tools.</br>

                    these tools don't just help us make things. they also push the whole tech world to try new things
                    and improve how humans make things, in a never-ending cycle of getting better.</br></br>

                    tools are fascinating. we shape them, and then they shape us. there’s something meta in them that
                    i’ve been drawn to since childhood: things that create, musical instruments, modular things, legos.
                    design tools are a crucial element in our everyday lives.</br></br>

                    these thoughts and experiences led me down the rabbit hole to the history of software development
                    and design tools.</br></br>

                    from xerox's desktop publishing to adobe's pdf and photoshop, and figma's pioneering user interface
                    design, design tools have shaped how we create and collaborate. these tools have guided us through
                    an evolution, leading us to this collaborative design era.</br></br>

                    even though we have advanced design tools, many are still built for old print media tasks, not for
                    today's digital screens. this mismatch slows down work because it requires extra steps to turn
                    designs into working digital products.</br></br>

                    this problem opens a big chance for us to think differently about how we make and use design tools.
                    by solving this, we can make design and development faster and more connected, which helps everyone
                    create better products quickly.</br></br>

                    tim berners-lee, who created the world wide web, mentioned that the first web browser was also an
                    editor. however, it was too early, and it couldn't turn it into a design tool. instead, we needed to
                    write code to make it work. now, things have changed. the limitation is gone. today, browsers can
                    easily be used as design tools—if we want to!</br></br>

                    here lies a golden opportunity. we can reinvent how we approach design and software development,
                    allowing us to harness the full potential of both disciplines.</br></br>

                    ai's capabilities are set to revolutionize the creation process by essentially automating coding
                    tasks. this shift brings design to the forefront while the development role evolves. this freedom
                    from grunt work lets us focus on the bigger picture. we can focus more on design, driving creation
                    that is faster, smarter, and more efficient than ever.</p>

                <p>rnbw is a tool designed to make web design and development easier and more effective by integrating
                    design directly with live coding. It is simple enough for anyone, flexible enough for anything, and
                    open enough for anyone to use it anyhow. built with the latest web technologies and ai, rnbw works
                    directly on your local files and doesn’t require complex setups.

                    being open source, rnbw invites users to contribute to its evolution, making it a community-driven
                    tool. this approach not only enhances the tool's capabilities but also fosters a strong sense of
                    community among its users.</br></br>

                    at rnbw, no detail is too small. to truly excel, we need to be significantly better, not just a
                    little bit better. we value every minute detail because they all contribute to creating
                    something
                    exceptional. we dedicate extra time to perfecting things that may only be noticed by a few, but
                    we
                    know that it's the sum of all these tiny details that ultimately make a big difference.</br></br>

                <h2>wait but why</h2>
                <p>brand story - people think rainbow is just half circle, but the truth is a rainbow is a full circle.
                    surprising, right? when we usually see a rainbow, it's from the ground and our horizon limits our
                    view to just a half-circle or arc. but if you ever get a chance to see a rainbow from an airplane,
                    or from a high mountain, you'll see it's a complete circle. this is due to the raindrops scattering
                    light in every direction, and it's only our perspective on the ground that limits our
                    view.</br></br>

                    like a rainbow, the whole world of design and development often goes unseen. we get tangled up in
                    tiny details, forgetting the big picture.</br></br>

                    design and development are two sides of the same coin, not separate worlds. but for so long, we've
                    treated them as if they were. here's the big secret - design is the practice of creation, and
                    development is the process of realization, bringing those creations to life.</br></br>

                    with rnbw, we're highlighting this hidden truth. we're showing the whole rainbow, not just half. by
                    bringing together design and development, we're making creating for the web easier, more natural,
                    and more effective.</br></br>

                    welcome to the age of full-circle creation.</br></br>

                    welcome to rnbw.

                <h3>it’s a business problem</h3>
                <p>imagine you're launching a company with a groundbreaking app idea that solves a real-world issue.
                    traditionally, the design and development stages are distinct—designers map out the interface, then
                    developers interpret these designs into code. this separation often leads to miscommunication and
                    inefficiencies, impacting user experience and squandering resources.

                    rnbw doesn't just bridge the gap - it eliminates it by merging design and code into a unified
                    workflow.
                    in rnbw, design is code and code is design. this seamless integration accelerates the development
                    process by allowing changes to be visualized and implemented in real time. the result is a dynamic,
                    collaborative environment where modifications on the design front instantly reflect in the code and
                    vice
                    versa.

                    this approach not only streamlines production but also enhances collaboration among team members,
                    ensuring that the final product faithfully represents the initial vision without the typical losses
                    in
                    translation.</p>
                <h3>the original sin</h3>
                <p>oday's design tools claim to offer a "single source of truth" for a product's design system.
                    however, it
                    raises the question of where the actual truth lies. is it in the designs created using these tools?
                    or
                    does it lie in the code used by developers to build the application? or, perhaps, do the tools that
                    bridge design and code represent a third, separate truth?</br></br>

                    most of today's design tools are built on a wrong idea: that design and development live in
                    separate,
                    imaginary worlds. but if design lives in too many different worlds, none of which are the actual
                    code
                    running on people's devices, it can never reach a 'single source of truth.’</br></br>

                    some people believe that website builders can help solve the problem of building a website, but in
                    reality, they are just tools for building websites and not for designing them. these builders are
                    suitable for creating simple websites, but not for web applications that require a more flexible and
                    advanced user interface to handle their complexity. unfortunately, website builders are not capable
                    of
                    providing such advanced user interfaces.</br></br>

                    here we are still struggling with the same old issue, searching for a single source of truth. since
                    no
                    tools effectively support this, it ultimately depends on personal communication.</p>
                <h3>source of truth</h3>
                <p>with rnbw, we no longer need a 'single source of truth.' sounds meh? let me explain. in this world,
                    design doesn't just exist - it thrives right in the heart of production.</br></br>

                    no more juggling multiple mediums trying to match design with code. in this world, designers feel
                    right
                    at home in a straightforward design environment. but there's a twist. they're not just sketching
                    pictures – they're shaping the actual thing!</br></br>

                    and while they do that, code is being cooked up in the background and blended into the development.
                    magic, isn't it?</br></br>

                    what’s the secret sauce? a refreshingly simple design experience that is also a development
                    environment.
                    designers own their designs and have the power to shape the live product.</br></br>

                    updates happen in the blink of an eye. no more waiting for developers. design is instant.</br></br>

                    product teams no longer need to trade off product quality. they can deliver an exceptional user
                    experience. everyone involved in the product cycle can see, touch, and interact with the product in
                    real-time, visually, and in context.</p>
                <h3>i design. therefore, i code</h3>
                <p>designers today are changing. they're becoming swiss army knives, masters of many trades, and the
                    market
                    loves it—the demand for these designer-developer hybrids has spiked.</br></br>

                    there's a massive low and no code category expected to grow, changing the entire software
                    development
                    space as the barrier to becoming a developer is very low thanks to ai and automation.</br></br>

                    industry giants like facebook, google, and airbnb recognize the power of design and design systems.
                    they're hiring top talent and developing internal tools to keep these systems strong and
                    effective.</br></br>

                    but what about the others? big enterprise companies are pouring time and money into trying to keep
                    up.
                    picture teams spread across the globe, facing talent shortages, isolated offices, and tricky time
                    zones.
                    enforcing consistent design systems is a challenge.</br></br>

                    then there are the small fries - freelancers, code-savvy designers, design-savvy coders, lean
                    startups,
                    and fast-growing young companies. they don't have the resources to focus on design systems. these
                    systems, if they exist at all, are often half-baked, leading to problems down the line.</br></br>

                <h2>✨design-as-code</h2>
                <p>"what's the secret sauce?" - it’s design-as-code. it's a unique design approach that's built into a
                    design tool, powered by code from the ground up, which uses a two-way design-code engine. this
                    approach eliminates the need for handoff and traditional design platforms. with a perfect blend of
                    simplicity, flexibility, and openness, it’s a game-changing solution for design
                    professionals.</br></br>

                    fast, zero latency, two-way design&lt;&gt;code synchronization. this means that you can make changes
                    on
                    one side and see the result immediately on the other side without any delay or interruption.
                    speed is crucial in this process, whether you are loading a page, adding or modifying elements,
                    or making an api call. our goal is to boost performance and reduce response times, always
                    striving to enhance speed and prioritize user convenience over our ease of development.</p>
                <h3>simple enough for anyone</h3>
                <p>our goal is to make it easy and fun for designers and anyone to use our product, so we keep the
                    barrier to entry low.</br></br>

                <p>
                    a company needs to keep the same design across many web apps. with rnbw, designers make web
                    components in the tool, setting styles, behaviors, and interactions. these components turn into live
                    code right away, which developers can use without having to change or rewrite them.</br></br>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            efficiency - cuts down on the back-and-forth usually needed between designers and
                            developers, making the production cycle faster.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            scalability - makes updates and changes easy, and they automatically reach all apps using
                            these components.
                        </li>

                    as the source of truth, rnbw enables both designers and developers to see and change the same
                    things.</br></br>

                            product, there’s no need to make sure the final product matches the design.

                <p>
                    a big company has a complex design system that often needs updates. rnbw helps by letting designers
                    edit and design directly in the system, where changes turn into code and get documented right
                    away.</br></br>

                        <li>
                            empowerment - gives designers more control and lets them make changes without waiting for
                            development, letting them have more say in the product.
