        <h1>A story of design and development tools</h1>

        <h4>The web is an open, unlimited medium. Is that really true? </h4>
        <h4>
          If you're a designer, you're probably like us, spending most of your
          days pushing pixels and creating in image-based design tools,
          struggling with the inconsistency across design and development
          environments, passing over files through multiple iterations to try
          almost hopelessly to reach some semblance of what it is you initially
          envisioned.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Paradoxically, The products we create are evolving, yet the tools we
          use to design them didn't change in over three decades. These existing
          tools keep us in a fixed, stagnant canvas, the form overshadows the
          function.
          <br>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Even more paradoxically, the more we are evolving the more it became
          complex to create for the web, while ancient design tools such as
          Flash were doing a better job at bringing designers to the web medium.
          <br>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Modern design tools are focusing on ideation, only simulating the
          functionality of the final product. Website builders are "simple" yet
          not flexible enough, enforces their paradigms, and limit the medium's
          possibilities. And - They are vendor-locked.
          <br>While custom solution such as WordPress is flexible, they are
          not simple enough and requires even more resources.
          <br>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          We've evolved excessively in design, yet the tools and processes we
          have are archaic, defunct, and lean too heavily on print. We're trying
          to make this broken process work, and it requires too much manual
          effort and documentation. If that's not bad enough, by the end of the
          day, designers don't have enough impact on the actual product.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Have you ever stopped to think - this could all be so different? Why
          are all of us designing complex component systems in static design
          tools and, even worse, handing them off instead of building the real
          thing ourselves?
        </h4>
        <h4>
          We at Rainbow, aim to remove the gaps. The next generation of design
          tools is coming, and we've imagined a future where creators work
          harmoniously to create beautiful, functional digital products.</h4>

          "The first web browser was also an editor. The idea being that not
          only could everyone read content on the web, but they could also help
          create it. It was to be a collaborative space for everyone."
