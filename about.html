      <h1>a story of design and development tools</h1>

      <h4>the web is an open, unlimited medium. is that really true?&nbsp;</h4>
      <h4> if you're a designer, you're probably like us, spending most of your
        days pushing pixels and creating in image-based design tools,
        struggling with the inconsistency across design and development
        environments, passing over files through multiple iterations to try
        almost hopelessly to reach some semblance of what it is you initially
        envisioned.
      </h4>
      <h4> paradoxically, the products we create are evolving, yet the tools we
        use to design them didn't change in over three decades. these existing
        tools keep us in a fixed, stagnant canvas, the form overshadows the
        function.
        <br>
      </h4>
      <h4> even more paradoxically, the more we are evolving the more it became
        complex to create for the web, while ancient design tools such as
        flash were doing a better job at bringing designers to the web medium.
        <br>
      </h4>
      <h4> modern design tools are focusing on ideation, only simulating the
        functionality of the final product. website builders are "simple" yet
        not flexible enough, enforces their paradigms, and limit the medium's
        possibilities. and - they are vendor-locked.
        <br>while custom solution such as wordpress is flexible, they are not simple enough and requires even more
        resources.
        <br>
      </h4>
      <h4> we've evolved excessively in design, yet the tools and processes we
        have are archaic, defunct, and lean too heavily on print. we're trying
        to make this broken process work, and it requires too much manual
        effort and documentation. if that's not bad enough, by the end of the
        day, designers don't have enough impact on the actual product.
      </h4>
      <h4> have you ever stopped to think - this could all be so different? why
        are all of us designing complex component systems in static design
        tools and, even worse, handing them off instead of building the real
        thing ourselves?
      </h4>
      <h4> we at rainbow, aim to remove the gaps. the next generation of design
        tools is coming, and we've imagined a future where creators work
        harmoniously to create beautiful, functional digital products.</h4>
      <h4>rainbow gives designers and developers the tools to build a better web. creators of rene.css. </h4>
      <h2> "the first web browser was also an editor. the idea being that not
        only could everyone read content on the web, but they could also help
        create it. it was to be a collaborative space for everyone."
